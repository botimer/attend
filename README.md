Sample Code - Multiple Styles
-----------------------------

This is a sample Tsugi application with several variations:

* Simple single-file application (master branch)
* Silex application (silex branch)
* Single file application that uses a handlebars templated rendered in the browser

These are permanent branches - to update a version, do it all in that branch.

To use handlebars version
-------------------------

    git checkout handlebars

To update handlebars version
----------------------------

    git status   (Make sure you are on the handlebars branch)
    git commit -a
    git push origin handlebars
