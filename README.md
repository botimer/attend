Sample Code - TMPLJS
--------------------

This is a simple single-page style using tmpljs templates.

https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates

All the data is retrieved using JSON and the POSTs are done to 
explicit handler scipts.

This does not do internationalization yet but the `locale` folder
is left in place temporarily.  I expect that the right thing to do
is a different style of i18n.

To use this version
-------------------

    git checkout tmpljs

To update this version
----------------------

    git commit -a
    git push origin tmpljs

This is based on work that we did in a hack-a-thon at University
